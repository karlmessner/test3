<p>Our elves are busily packaging it to send to your recipients. That might take a few minutes&emdash; they have tiny hands. When the elves are done, we'll send it to your recipients and send you a second email that it got off successfully.</p>

<p>P.S. This is the <a href="{{downloadLink}}" target="_blank">Link</a> They'll get and you can share with others. Once the elves are done, your video will play there. <strong>We won't send the email to your recipients until the video is done.</strong></p>
